# Residential Energy Controller

This repository contains a safety-first control and forecasting framework
for residential solar–battery–grid systems.

Scope (current):
- Domestic inverter-based systems
- Real-time, edge-executed control logic
- Explicit inverter, battery, and grid constraints
- Short-horizon forecasting (advisory only)

Out of scope (for now):
- UI / mobile applications
- Hardware deployment
- Microgrid or utility-scale control

This project is developed incrementally, with a strong emphasis on
correctness, explainability, and real-world electrical constraints.
